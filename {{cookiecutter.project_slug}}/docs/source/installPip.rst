Installation with PIP
---------------------

If you have access to the `University of Illinois Python package repository <https://devpi.library.illinois.edu/>`_, and
there is an `existing package <https://devpi.library.illinois.edu/production/release/{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}>`_, this is
going to be the easiest option to install.



1) Open a command prompt/terminal.
2) Activate your Python 3 environment.
3) Type the following command::

    python -m pip install {{cookiecutter.project_slug}}

All finished! {{cookiecutter.project_name}} should now be installed.
